## 🚀 BlockChain-Working-Visualization  
A **TypeScript-based interactive visualization** of how a blockchain works, including **block creation, hashing, mining, and transaction validation**.  

### 🎯 Features  
✅ **Block Creation** – Users can create and link blocks dynamically  
✅ **SHA-256 Hashing** – Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block  
✅ **Proof of Work** – Adjustable mining difficulty for block validation  
✅ **Transactions Simulation** – Simple transactions stored within blocks  
✅ **Live Visualization** – Animations to showcase the working mechanism  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **TypeScript**  
- **React.js** (for UI)  
- **D3.js** (for data visualization)  
- **Node.js + Express** (for backend, if needed)  

### 📦 Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlockChain-Working-Visualization.git  
cd BlockChain-Working-Visualization  
npm install  
npm start  
```
